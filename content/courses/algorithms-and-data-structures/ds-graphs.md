## Graphs

A _graph_ is a pointer-based data structure that represents a network of `n` distinct nodes. A connection between two nodes is called an _edge_. An edge between two nodes `u` and `v` is denoted by `e(u, v)`. The nodes `u` and `v` are adjacent to each other.

A _directed graph_ is a graph where the edges have an associated direction.
A _weighted graph_ is a graph where the edges have an associated numerical weight.
